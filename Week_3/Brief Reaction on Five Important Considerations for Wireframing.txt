Design means so much more than what is widely known for the term ¡°design.¡± It is making things work, and the constant struggle and success of making things work better, that signify the essence of design, including but not limited to redesign. To achieve all this, the first thing is to nullify the idea that ¡°I think this way will work,¡± or ¡°I think this design is better.¡±
¡°Every decision UX designers make is validated through research¡± is perhaps what human-centered design is fundamentally based on. The research process then, is the cycle of Ideate, Build, Test, Iterate and Ideateÿ And that cycle is under the reality of time constraint, so it is not a cycle moving still, but a cycle moving slowly / crawling forward.
What designers have in mind sometimes, or oftentimes, is not exactly what users need. Good UX designers use data to validate their design, and such data is collected through the above mentioned cycle of research.
User research is perhaps the most important component of User Experience design. But the premise of understanding users, is to stop imagining what your users are like, and to start acknowledging their actual problems and needs.
The purpose of user research, is to remove the designer in the design, and infuse user into it. By that it means the designer¡¯s personal preference should not be evident it his or her design unless it is tested and verified through research, because otherwise such preference is only potentially false assumptions.
